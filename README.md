# Paint by Paul

A non-profit commission project for Astrolope (Paul Geldart). The website was live on paintbypaul.xyz for about a year. 
Art and code assets by yours truly, audio and photography by the musician.

Overall design is reminiscent of MSPaint and 90's era internet. Enjoy the popups!

Experience is live at https://vulture-boy.github.io/paintbypaul/
